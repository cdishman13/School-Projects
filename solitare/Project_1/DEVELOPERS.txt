int compareword(int size, char* str, FILE* inf)
	This fuction compares the next string in the file to the string 'str' of size 'size'.

int validcard(int c)
	This fuction checks to make sure that the card number is valid

int validatecolumn(char *p, char *c)
	This function checks if the current card can be put with previous card

char convert(char c)
	This function converts the letter cards with different characters so they 
	can more easily be compared in the function validatecolumn

void consumeWS(FILE* inf)
	This function gets rid of all white space and finds the next character

int rulecheck(FILE* inf)
	This function checks the RULES: section
	It checks the amount of turns, should be 1 or 3
	It checks for "unlimited" or "limit N" where N is a number from 0-9

int foundationcheck(FILE* inf)
	This function checks the FOUNDATION: section
	This section checks the foundations 
	The foundations are in the order clubs, diamonds, hearts, then spades
	Checks if the number is valid, then checks the suit

int main(int argc, char **argv)
	In the main function the program reads in the text input file
	To parse the text file, first get rid of any comments and white space before the RULES: section
	Then we use the function rulecheck to check the rule section
	Then we get rid of any whitespace until the FOUNDATION: section
	Then we use the function foundationcheck to check the foundation section
	Then we get rid of any whitespace until the TABLEAU: section
	Then we use the function tablecheck to check the tableau section
	Then we get rid of any whitespace until the STOCK: section
	Then we use the function stockcheck to check the stock section
	Then we get rid of whitespace until the MOVES: section
	Then we use the functino movecheck to check the moves section
	Then the function prints the output
	Then the function ends
